# Miscelaneous

If you are feeling adventurous, try learning Git with [Githug](https://github.com/Gazler/githug).

If you are looking for an excellent command line Git client try [Tig](http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/).

If you use Vim then I can't recommend enough the [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) plugin.
